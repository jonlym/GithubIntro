# README
The current file we are reading is the README. This file is a springboard to tell users important information, such as:

- what the package does
- who is maintaining it
- where the documentation is located
- what are its dependencies (i.e. other packages that it uses)
- what permissions do you authorize to users (i.e. licenses).

# Documentation
